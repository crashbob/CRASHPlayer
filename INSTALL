NOTE: These instruction are available for use to those who are assisting with the CRASHPlayer open-source project as a developer or tester. If you are not contributing to this project in one of these capacities, you should install the app from the app store when it becomes available. 

This INSTALL file will tell you how to install the latest build of CRASHPlayer on your TV to test it. These instructions don't tell you how to create a new custom build of CRASHPlayer from source. For those instructions, you will need to checkout the entire repo from gitub and follow the development instructions for Yahoo. Further links to the Yahoo instructions are at the end of this document. 

The Yahoo instructions to install an app on your TV can be found here: https://developer.yahoo.com/connectedtv/installguide/CTV_IG_Testing_on_a_Consumer_Device.html

Specific instructions for CRASHPlayer are below: 

* You first need to download the latest compiled build of the CRASHPlayer widget. Download it at the following link: 
    https://github.com/crashbob/CRASHPlayer/blob/master/com.crashplayer.yctv.crashplayer-1.0.11.widget?raw=true

* If you want all the other icons and graphics to show up properly, also download the following image files:

* On your TV in the Profiles screen, sign into your profile with your Yahoo ID and password. 

* On your TV, you need to enable Developer apps. 
    Press the Yahoo TV/Vizio button on the remote. 
    Launch the TV store. 
    Press the Green key on your remote while you are in the TV Store or click the settingsbutton on the bottom of the screen. (See screenshots on the link above.) 
    Select the Developer Settings button. 
    Toggle the Show My Test Apps button to On. 
    Sign in with your Yahoo ID. 
    A Developer Code will be displayed on the screen. 
    Make note of this dev code, as you will need it later. 

* Next you need to upload your CRASHPlayer app to the widget developer store following these instructions. 
    Login to the Yahoo TV App Upload Tool at https://gallery.tv.widgets.yahoo.com/publisher/
